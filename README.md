## Description
The Hangman Game Project is a simple console-based word guessing game implemented in Python. The aim of this project is to demonstrate fundamental Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and data structures. Through building this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of Python syntax and problem-solving in programming.

## Installation
To install and run this project, you will need Python installed on your system. Follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/LeeTaylorLondon/hangman720`
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd hangman

## Usage
To play the game, run the main script from the command line: `python milestone_5.py`

Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters and try to figure out the word before running out of lives.
