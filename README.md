## Description
This project is a Python application designed to randomly 
select fruits from a list. It's aimed at demonstrating 
basic Python programming concepts, including list handling, 
user input, and conditional statements. During this project, 
I improved my understanding of Python syntax and learned how 
to use Git for version control.
